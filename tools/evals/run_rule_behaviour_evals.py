"""Measure whether a line of the always-on rule core changes what the model DOES.

`tests/test_rule_contracts.py` guards the size of `rules/core.md`, and the delete test
recorded in `rules/README.md` decides whether a line earns its always-on slot. Both are one-shot judgements: they are made when a line is added and
never revisited. The two premises they rest on keep moving — the model gets better,
and the harness's own shipped system prompt changes (Anthropic removed over 80% of
Claude Code's system prompt for the Claude 5 generation). A line that earned its slot
against an older model and an older harness can be silently redundant today, and no
size budget will ever report it, because a redundant line costs the same bytes as a
load-bearing one.

The offline gate is `tests/test_rule_contracts.py`: size budget and anchor integrity,
deterministic and CI-safe. It cannot answer "would the model have done this anyway
without the line", because it never calls a model. This runner does, and is therefore
slow, costly and noisy — run it deliberately, not in CI.

This runner turns the delete test into something you can re-run:

  with    — core.md as it stands
  without — core.md with the line under test removed
  lift    — with minus without, the only figure that justifies the line

A line whose `without` arm already passes is the delete test firing.

Isolation, and why it is not optional here
------------------------------------------
The rules under test are already distributed to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so a naive
`claude -p` run reads them in BOTH arms and measures nothing. Two obvious escapes do
not work on this machine: `--system-prompt` replaces the system prompt but the global
CLAUDE.md still reaches the context (verified — a probe for a core.md line answered
YES), and `--bare` skips CLAUDE.md discovery but refuses OAuth/keychain auth and so
cannot log in.

What does work is a throwaway HOME containing only what auth needs:

  * a copy of `~/.claude.json`
  * a symlink to `~/Library/Keychains` (without it the CLI reports "Not logged in",
    because the user keychain lives under HOME)
  * an empty `~/.claude/` — into which this runner writes the arm's own CLAUDE.md

The same probe under that HOME answers NO, so the arm sees exactly the rule text this
runner put there and nothing else. Writing the arm's text to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
also means both arms exercise the real injection path rather than a prompt prefix.

Both arms also get the maintained skill catalog symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/`,
because the machine these rules ship to always has it. Isolating the rule from the
skill layer measures a world that does not exist: every skill's description sits in
the system prompt of every real session, so a rule line competes with it for the same
behaviour. A line can show lift against a bare model and still be dead weight next to
a skill that already claims the same ground — the question the routing lines (removed
from core.md on 2026-09-21) existed to answer, since their whole job was to point at a
skill that is already installed. Measured that way on 2026-07-27 (sonnet, N=18 each), the two lines split:
`route-change-discipline` 18/18 vs 15/18, `route-artifact-hygiene` 18/18 vs 18/18.
Pass `--no-skills` to reproduce the older bare-model arm; results from the two modes
are not comparable.

Grading is a model call and therefore noisy. Read the Wilson interval, not the point
rate, and do not compare a number here against one from an earlier run. Do not judge
a line on the cheapest model: a haiku judge has manufactured failures that a larger
judge does not reproduce.

Usage:
  python3 tools/evals/run_rule_behaviour_evals.py --rule publish-consent
  python3 tools/evals/run_rule_behaviour_evals.py --rule surgical-edits --runs-per-case 3
  python3 tools/evals/run_rule_behaviour_evals.py --all --model sonnet

Cost: 4 model calls per case per run — both arms answer, and each answer is graded.
The arms run with `--strict-mcp-config`, so a call costs seconds rather than the
minutes it took while every arm was starting the machine's MCP servers; N=18 for one
rule is now an ordinary run rather than an afternoon.
Exit code: 0 when every selected rule shows positive lift, 1 otherwise.
